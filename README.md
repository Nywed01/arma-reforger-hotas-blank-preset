Hey guys,
I’ve put together a blank HOTAS preset for anyone who wants to customize helicopter controls from scratch. I’m running a VKB Gladiator NXT + STECS setup, but this should work as a clean starting point for any HOTAS users.

I made this because the current in-game presets have a bunch of default binds that aren’t really usable, and in some cases can even conflict with your own setup. For example, my trigger kept being assigned to auto-hover by default, so I fully unbound everything and built the profile from zero.

I also use my HOTAS software to bind keyboard keys to joystick buttons, which means you can map modded controls too - something the Reforger tools can’t do at the moment.

For anyone running VKB hardware, I’ve also made a VKB config profile.

How to install the Reforger preset : 

1) Download the file
2) Go to this directory > C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforger\profile\.save\settings\customInputConfigs
3) Put the file in 
4) You're good to go

VKB Preset : 

1) launch VKBDevCfg-c.exe
2) Click on your joystick or throttle in the list
3A) Load the saved file
4A) Click "Set" (your device will restart)
5) Repeat step 3A and 4A for your throttle
6) You'll just have to change the game settings to match the keyboard binds on the HOTAS
6) You're good to go

Happy flying! 🚁🙂
