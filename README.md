Hey guys,
I’ve put together a blank HOTAS preset for anyone who wants to customize helicopter controls from scratch. I’m running a VKB Gladiator NXT + STECS setup, but this should work as a clean starting point for any HOTAS users.

I made this because the current in-game presets have a bunch of default binds that aren’t really usable, and in some cases can even conflict with your own setup. For example, my trigger kept being assigned to auto-hover by default, so I fully unbound everything and built the profile from zero.

I also use my HOTAS software to bind keyboard keys to joystick buttons, which means you can map modded controls too - something the Reforger tools can’t do at the moment.

For anyone running VKB hardware, I’ve also made a VKB config profile and will link it below for convenience with the blank config file.

Happy flying! 🚁🙂
